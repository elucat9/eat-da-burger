#EAT-DA-BURGER! Restaurant App
###Tools and tech: Node Express, Handlebars, MySQL, javascript, JQuery


This restaurant app allow users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. When the user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger as a button under the "To be eaten:" heading, waiting to be devoured. 

When the user clicks on a burger, the burger will move down under the "Devoured:" heading. (I couldn't figure out how to code this, but if I manually update the MySQL table, the burger's status will update.)

Every burger is stored in the database, whether eaten or not.
